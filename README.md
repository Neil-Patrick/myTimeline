## 📖 Overview
From the **1940s to the early 1970s**, machine learning emerged as a field of curiosity and experimentation.  
This period is known as **“The Old Era: The Historical Foundation of Machine Learning.”**  

Pioneers introduced:
- **Neural models** 🧩  
- **Early algorithms** 🔢  
- **Symbolic systems** 📐  

Despite limitations and the first **AI winter**, this era established the foundations that shaped the future of machine learning.

## 📅 Timeline of Key Events

### 1943 – McCulloch & Pitts’ Neuron Model  
🔗 [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDr0HxUI3Bo)  
Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts introduced a **mathematical model of the biological neuron**.  
It proved that simple logical functions could be computed by neuron networks, laying the foundation of neural networks.

---

### 1949 – Hebb’s Theory  
🔗 [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDTf7QYUq48)  
Psychologist **Donald Hebb** published *The Organization of Behavior*.  
Famous principle: *“Neurons that fire together wire together.”*  
This influenced the design of learning algorithms adjusting weights between connections.

---

### 1950 – Alan Turing’s “Turing Test”  
🔗 [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXMLF54AUwU)  
Alan Turing proposed the **Imitation Game**, later called the **Turing Test**.  
It evaluated whether a machine could mimic human intelligence, sparking debates on machine reasoning.

---

### 1951 – Samuel’s Checkers Program  
🔗 [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h0QpNWrPbg)  
Arthur Samuel developed a **checkers-playing program** that improved with experience.  
This was among the first demonstrations of **machine learning in action**.

---

### 1956 – Dartmouth Workshop (Birth of AI)  
🔗 [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FX2wmJ1fAQ)  
The **Dartmouth Summer Research Project on AI** officially established AI as a research field.  
Led by John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, machine learning was recognized under the AI umbrella.

---

### 1957 – The Perceptron  
🔗 [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip6RIHwi21c)  
Frank Rosenblatt introduced the **Perceptron**, an early artificial neural network capable of pattern recognition.  
It generated great optimism but was later criticized for its **limitations**.

---

### 1966 – ELIZA and Symbolic AI  
🔗 [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jGpkdPO-1Y)  
Joseph Weizenbaum created **ELIZA**, a program simulating human conversation.  
Symbolic AI approaches (rules & logic) dominated, but showed weaknesses in handling real-world complexity.

---

### 1967 – Nearest Neighbor Algorithm  
🔗 [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yqPXTNau5w)  
The **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** algorithm emerged as an early **pattern recognition method**, showing the promise of statistical approaches.

---

### 1969 – Perceptron Limitations Exposed  
🔗 [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqbTMQDGfYs)  
Marvin Minsky & Seymour Papert published *Perceptrons*, revealing its **inability to solve complex problems**.  
This slowed neural network research and contributed to the first **AI winter**.

---

### 1973 – First AI Winter (Lighthill Report)  
🔗 [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeE7qqoeCXg)  
The **Lighthill Report (UK)** criticized AI’s lack of practical results.  
Funding cuts caused many projects to halt, marking the **end of the foundation era**.
